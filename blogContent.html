            <h2 class="bHeading">About my Engineering Carrier</h2>
            <p class="BlogDetail">In the year of 2021(August) I appeared for the JELET(Joint Entrance Examination for Lateral Entry). My rank was 3114. After counseling I get the college known as RCC Institute of Information and Technology. I choosed Computer Science and Engineering. By the way I also completed my Diploma from Jnan Chandra Ghosh Polytechnic College. I got various Job opportunities in Wipro, Appolo Tires, Normet etc. But I want to learn more and also wanted to be graduated. So I choosed higher studies. I took the admission in this college in the month of September. Actually I didn't have any idea what to study. Then my college friends helped me. They suggested me various kinds of online study resources. Then I started my data structures and algorithms using C and C++ language. I will complete the course in the year of 2024. Now I am learning DSA and Web application Development(HTML,CSS and JS) from online Youtube channel. This portfolio is my little try to show all the people that what actual I have learned. The college is also very good and Teachers and seniors are also very helpful. Because of their proper guidance I learn much more about the carrier objectives. The above picture is the main gate of new building of my college.</p>

            <h2 class="bHeading">About my Skills</h2>
            <p class="BlogDetail">When I started my B.tech carrier in Computer Science and Engineering(2021) I started to learn Data Structures and Algorithms with C and C++. My college friends suggested me to do so.I didnot have any idea about those subject at that time because I was from Electronics and Communication background(Diploma). Still I am learning this and now I am solveing the easy and medium level questions from Leetcode because everyone knows that DSA is much more vast. I also learning frontend Web application development. My all learning source is Youtube and Online informative sites. I also have a will to start the development carrier in ReactJS.  </p>

            <h2 class="bHeading">The Golden days of Nabagram Vidyapith</h2>
            <p class="BlogDetail">
                This was one of the favourite places of mine. My school Nabagram Vidyapith from where I completed my class X and class XII(pure science). Those days were very amazing. There were lots of friends. The book fair near the school, the teachers, the classes, the school events etc all were very much exciting. In those time we didnot have any pressures and our minds were also very childish. In those time we never faceed any kind of difficulties. Actually we did not realise that in the Job field there are much more competitions. In class 11 and 12 I had 4 friends group and from those days to now we all are still good friends. We always seat on last bench, went to school and came back home together,went for a mini trips, fairs, Durgapuja Mandap(Kolkata), resturants together, played with rain in rainy season and lots more. Those days were lots of fun. So those days were golden days for me and my friends.
