            <h2>About my Engineering Carrier</h2>
        <p>In the year of 2021(August) I appeared for the JELET(Joint Entrance Examination for Lateral Entry). My rank was 3114. After counseling I get the college known as RCC Institute of Information and Technology. I choosed Computer Science and Engineering. By the way I also completed my Diploma from Jnan Chandra Ghosh Polytechnic College. I got various Job opportunities in Wipro, Appolo Tires, Normet etc. But I want to learn more and also wanted to be graduated. So I choosed higher studies. I took the admission in this college in the month of September. Actually I didn't have any idea what to study. Then my college friends helped me. They suggested me vari0us kinds of online study resources. Then I started my data structures and algorithms using C and C++ language. I will complete the course in the year of 2024. Now I am learning DSA and Web application Development(HTML,CSS and JS) from online Youtube channel. This portfolio is my little try to show all the people that what actual I have learned. The college is also very good and Teachers and seniors are also very helpful. Because of their proper guidance I learn much more about the carrier objectives. The above picture is the main gate of new building of my college.</p>
